# Daakia

Daakia helps you hack a messaging protocol / build your own.

Code and API are extremely unstable. The project is at an experimental stage right now. Use at your own risk


## Why Daakia? / Should I use this funny sounding project?

### Ideology
**The conflict**
* Traditional messaging servers and protocols are treated as rigid black boxes.
* Businesses change quickly and need flexibility. 
* Often it boils down to features that might have warranted a slightly different protocol.

**Possible resolutions**
* Write code around the messaging layer. This is the most common approach taken. A Sub-protocol on application messages sound familiar?
* If the server has a good extensions/plugins system, write extensions to support!
* Hack the messaging server in places which might make it incompatible with future updates of the software.

**What's different with Daakia?**
Daakia is built around libraries and code generation. As a result everything is swappable and extensible.

Each lib is supposed to be

* ~~User session mgr~~
* ~~Multi channel listeners~~
*	Session manager
*	Service Discovery
*	Protocol Compliance
*	Metrics mgr
